# 💯 100 Days of JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my **100 Days of JavaScript Projects** challenge! 🚀

In this repository, I'm committing to building **one JavaScript project every day for 100 days** to sharpen my frontend development skills, explore modern JavaScript practices, and build a robust project portfolio. Each project is created using **vanilla JavaScript** (unless specified) and showcases unique concepts, logic, or interactivity.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Master core JavaScript concepts
- Build a strong portfolio of mini-projects
- Improve problem-solving & coding speed
- Practice consistency and discipline
